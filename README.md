*  **A** is for affirm, transparency of knowldge share

*  **P** is for please, the way you always do

*  **L** is for luxury, the luxury of your smile

*  **Y** is for You

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
The traditional approach followed by general insurance companies (P&C) does not facilitate frequent customer engagement between insurer and their clients (automobile policyholders  interact with the insurer once every year i.e. for renewal). Thus the revenue per customer has limited scope to improve. 


#### SOLUTION APPLICATION 
As simply put, it is uberization of the general insurance industry. 

Our solution enables insurers to engage with their clients frequently in an automated fashion. We promote dynamic pricing for articles insured only when they are used e.g. duration for which car parked in the garage would not call for premium payment (of course if the customers want it, they can)

By appropriate usage of customer location and customer driven inputs, he/she can decide when the product should be insured at an optimal price. Likewise depending on the location and other inputs, customer could momentary increase the coverage (driving car on treacherous terrain) .

 - /datasets - Contains all the data used in the project
 - /codes - Contains the jupyter notebook used to create the datasets. 
 - /modelling xmls - Contains the XML reports for the models built. Use these XMLs to replicate the model assets in your environment
 - /website - Contains all Zaply web app and Mobile web app codes
 - /docker - Contains the docker commands to demo container replication
